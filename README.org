* CBC_VIDEO
  CBC web player does not provide direct MP4 urls, however they can be queried directly from:
  [[http://feed.theplatform.com/f/h9dtGB/r3VD0FujBumK?%2527%2B%2522&form%3Djson&range%3D1-100][http://feed.theplatform.com/f/h9dtGB/r3VD0FujBumK?%27+%22&form=json&range=1-100]

  This code simply queries the URL (from the client browser) and parses the results.

* Technology

** server
  - [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node js]]
  - [[http://expressjs.com/][Express js]]
  - [[http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/][swig]] ( templating )

** client
  - [[http://getbootstrap.com/][bootstrap]]
  - [[https://jquery.com/][jQuery]]
  - [[http://handlebarsjs.com/][handlebars js]] ( templating )

* INSTALL
  While this doesn't HAVE to be run from Node for development reasons it express was used.
  Other reason is to beable to deploy the code to Heroku.

  Typical Node/express setup:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ git clone git@github.com:jjrh/CBC_VIDEO.git
  $ npm install
  $ ./run_server.sh 3030
  #+END_SRC

  For the most part CDN's have been used for libraries.
